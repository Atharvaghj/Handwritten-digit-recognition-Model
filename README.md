This basic project implements a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from the popular MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it achieves high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits through a convolutional neural network (CNN).

Features:

Dataset: MNIST (60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels)

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple layers

Libraries Used: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

Training: Trained on the MNIST dataset with optimized parameters

Evaluation: Achieves over 96% accuracy on the test set

Visualization: Displays sample predictions with actual labels
